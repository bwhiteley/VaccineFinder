# Vaccine Finder

An iOS app that uses an API from the Utah County Health Department to track COVID-19 vaccine availability in Utah County. 

Apple won't allow this app in the app store because they are very strict about only allowing apps dealing with COVID-19 information to be published from government entities or well-known health services providers. See [section 5.1.1 (ix) of the App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#data-collection-and-storage).
